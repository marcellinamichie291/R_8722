That's what is expected.
When you are rejected.

I'm injected by your synthetic.

And I don't think that I can be fixed.
No, I don't think that I can be fixed.
Tel me why, oh why, are my synthetic such a bitch?

It's this blood condition!
Damn this mind condition!
Mother, can you hear me?
Thanks for the disease!
Now I am implicated.
Part of the collection.

That's what is expected.
When you are suspected.

How much of it's synthetic?
How much of it is fate?
How much of it depends on the choices that we make?
She says I have his look,
Do I also inherit her shame?
Is heredity the culprit?
Can I stop it? Or am I a slave?

I'm suspected by your pathetic.
I'm injected by your synthetic.
What hope has a girl who is sick?
Why dream of a life past this fence?
It really makes no difference,
'Cause I know that I'll never be fixed
Tell me why, oh why, are my synthetic such a bitch!

But oh, I want to go outside, outside...
But oh, I will to go outside, outside...
