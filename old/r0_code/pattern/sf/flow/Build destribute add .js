// Guide users through creating a lead
Build a flow that creates a lead with user-entered information and uploads a related file for the lead. Then add the flow to a Home page.

    Create a flow:
        Type: Screen Flow
        Build: Freeform
    Add a screen:
        Label: Lead Screen
        API Name: Lead_Screen
        Add two text screen components to the New Lead screen:
            Label: Last Name
            API Name: Last_Name
            Label: Company Name
            API Name: Company_Name
            Mark both text components required
    Add an element:
        Element: Create Records
        Label: Create Lead
        API Name: Create_Lead
        How to Set the Record Fields: Use separate resources, and literal values
        Object: Lead
        Set Field Values for the Lead:
            Last Name
                Value: Last_Name in Screen Components
            Company
                Value: Company_Name in Screen Components
    Add a second screen:
        Label: Component Screen
        API Name: Component_Screen
        Add a File Upload component to the second screen:
            API Name: Upload_File
            File Upload Label: Upload Related Files
            Allow Multiple Files: {!$GlobalConstant.True}
            Related Record ID: LeadId from Create_Lead
    Connect the flow components:
        Start
        Lead Screen
        Create Lead
        Component Screen
    Save the flow:
        Flow Label: New Lead
        Flow API Name: New_Lead
    Activate the flow
    Create a Lightning page:
        Type: Home Page
        Label: Process Automation Home
        Page Template: Standard Home Page
        Developer Name: Process_Automation_Home (we wonâ€™t check for this)
        Add a Flow component that references the New Lead flow
        Activate the page and assign it as the org default
